# so you want to make a starg3n mirror?

you need to fork:

[homepage](https://github.com/starg3n/starg3n.github.io)

[hl1](https://github.com/starg3n/hl1)

[ds](https://github.com/starg3n/ds)

[ps1](https://github.com/starg3n/ps1)

in each of these repos click _settings_, _pages_, then under _branch_, click "None" and change it to "main"

---

once you've forked those and set up the gh pages you need to go to the **homepage** repo, go to _index.html_ and change the hl1, ds, and ps1 links to what they are under your account. sm64, eagler, gba, cookie, spelunky and flash do not need to be changed because they are in the **homepage** repo.

(the other repos have a link back to starg3n, so you may need to change those as well)

**make sure when setting up ps1 the link includes PlayStation.htm at the end of the link**

**the gba roms are hosted on starg3n/gba-alt** (check my repos) **and those do NOT need to be forked!!**

start an issue on the og starg3n repo or message appakling on discord for help!
