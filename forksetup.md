# so you want to make a starg3n mirror?

you need to fork:

[homepage](https://github.com/starg3n/starg3n.github.io)

[hl1](https://github.com/starg3n/hl1)

[ds](https://github.com/starg3n/ds)

[ps1](https://github.com/starg3n/ps1)

[gba](https://github.com/starg3n/gba)

[bitburner](https://github.com/starg3n/bitburner)

in each of these repos click _settings_, _pages_, then under _branch_, click "None" and change it to "main"

---

once you've forked those and set up the gh pages you need to go to the **homepage** repo, go to _index.html_ and change the hl1, gba ds, and ps1 links to what they are under your account. 

**sm64, eagler, cookie, 1page html, pico 8, spelunky and flash do not need to be changed because they are in the *homepage* repo.**

(the other repos have a link back to starg3n, so you may need to change those as well)

**make sure when setting up ps1 the link includes PlayStation.htm at the end of the link**

start an issue on the og starg3n repo or message appakling on discord for help!
